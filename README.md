## Introduction

This project was developed as part of a collaborative effort between [Roxy](https://github.com/roxyabedi) and [Jordan](https://github.com/jordannapoleon) over a two-day pair programming session. Throughout this two-week sprint, we focused on a variety of technical topics and skills. Our learning journey included unit testing, object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) with inheritance, Java streams, collections, and advanced database management techniques such as aggregates, group by, having, joins, subqueries, and database design. We also explored JavaScript event handling and worked with Thymeleaf and Spring Boot. The primary objective was to deepen our understanding and enhance our proficiency in these areas through practical application and collaboration.

## Key Aspects of the Project

- **Collaborative Development:**  
  The project was a shared endeavor where all team members actively contributed their expertise and insights. This collaborative approach enabled us to tackle complex problems together and integrate our individual strengths into the project.

- **Effective Planning:**  
  We engaged in thorough planning to ensure a structured approach. By clearly defining our goals, dividing tasks based on skills, and setting milestones, we were able to manage our time efficiently and meet our objectives.

- **Clear Communication:**  
  Open and effective communication was fundamental to our success. Regular discussions, updates, and feedback loops allowed us to stay aligned, address issues promptly, and ensure that all contributors were on the same page.

- **Collaborative Decision-Making:**  
  Decision-making was a joint process, with input from all team members contributing to choices and solutions. This collaborative decision-making process helped us achieve well-rounded solutions and incorporate diverse perspectives into our project.

## Project Overview

The project is a quiz application designed using an MVC model with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. The application leverages JavaScript event listeners for dynamic user interaction and Thymeleaf fragments for modular and reusable HTML components. This approach ensures a seamless and engaging user experience while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

This project demonstrates our ability to effectively apply Sprint 2 concepts in a practical application. By integrating event listeners and Thymeleaf fragments, we were able to enhance both the functionality and user experience of our quiz app, showcasing our skills in development, user interaction, and efficient use of modern web technologies.


#### Describe Your Development Process

Our development process was methodical and collaborative, aimed at ensuring a well-structured and functional quiz application. Here’s a detailed overview of our approach:

1. **Planning and Design:**
   - **Initial Diagrams:** We began by creating diagrams to visualize our initial thoughts and architecture for the quiz application. These diagrams helped us map out the structure of the application, including the MVC model components and user interactions. We used these diagrams to ensure a clear understanding of the project requirements and design before diving into development.
   - **Sketching Menus and User Flow:** A significant portion of our planning involved sketching out the user interface menus and documenting various data elements needed for the application. We carefully considered how users would interact with the app, ensuring that the navigation and functionality were intuitive and user-friendly.

2. **Task Management:**
   - **Trello Board:** To manage our tasks efficiently, we utilized Trello. We created a board to track the progress of different features and tasks, from initial setup and development to testing and final touches. This tool helped us maintain a clear overview of our workflow, assign responsibilities, and monitor deadlines.

3. **Documentation:**
   - **Data and Functionality Documentation:** We documented the data requirements and functionalities in detail, which included defining the data models, possible user inputs, and expected outputs. This documentation served as a reference throughout the development process to ensure consistency and completeness.

We’ve included screenshots of our design diagrams and Trello board to provide a visual representation of our workflow and planning process.
